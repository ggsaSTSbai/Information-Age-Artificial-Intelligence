    <h2>A. The Information Age</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>The Information Age (also called the Digital Age, Computer Age, Internet Age, Digital Revolution) refers to a historical period in which economies and societies shifted from traditional industrialization toward information processing, digital communication, and information technology.</p>
    <p>The core of the Information Age is the ability to create, process, store, and transmit information in digital form — making "information" a key economic and social resource rather than just physical goods.</p>

  <!-- TAB 3: Key Characteristics -->
  <div class="tab" id="tab3">
    <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
    <ul class="bullet-points">
      <li><strong>Digitization:</strong> Converting analog information into digital data (text, audio, video) — easier storage, copying, and transmission.</li>
      <li><strong>Miniaturization & affordability:</strong> Computers and digital devices became smaller, cheaper, widely available.</li>
      <li><strong>Global connectivity:</strong> Internet networks enabled near-instant communication globally.</li>
      <li><strong>Rapid information dissemination:</strong> News, media, knowledge, personal communication shared widely and quickly.</li>
      <li><strong>Shift in economic/social value:</strong> Information and data became as valuable or more than industrial goods.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- TAB 4: Impact -->
  <div class="tab" id="tab4">
    <h2>Impact on Communication, Learning, Entertainment</h2>
    <ul class="bullet-points">
      <li><strong>Communication:</strong> People can now communicate instantly across continents — email, messaging, video calls — something impossible in pre-Internet eras. Digital communication networks replaced many analog mediums.</li>
      <li><strong>Learning / Education:</strong> Access to information exploded — digital libraries, online articles, research, educational resources. This transformed how people learn, research, and teach. The Information Age changed schooling methods and curricula to reflect that new digital exposure.</li>
      <li><strong>Entertainment & Media:</strong> Digitally recorded media (music, video) replaced analog formats (vinyl, tapes). The Internet and computers enabled new forms of entertainment — digital games, streaming, online video, user-generated content.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Networks & Communities:</strong> Platforms enabling people to share photos, videos, stories globally — expanding social networks far beyond physical communities. </li>
    </ul>

  <!-- TAB 5: Artificial Intelligence -->
  <div class="tab" id="tab5">
    <h2>B. Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
    <h3>What is AI?</h3>
    <p>AI refers to digital computers or machines performing tasks that normally require human intelligence — learning, reasoning, pattern recognition, language understanding, problem-solving.</p>
    <p>AI systems mimic aspects of human cognition, but not all nuances of thinking or consciousness.</p>

    <h3>Types of AI</h3>
    <ul class="bullet-points">
      <li><strong>Narrow / Weak AI:</strong> Performs specific tasks (voice recognition, recommendations, image recognition).</li>
      <li><strong>General AI:</strong> Hypothetical AI that can perform any intellectual task a human can (not yet achieved).</li>
      <li>Levels include reactive machines, limited memory, theory-of-mind, self-aware AI (mostly speculative).</li>
      <li>Technical perspective: rule-based systems, machine learning, deep learning / neural networks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How AI works</h3>
    <p>AI relies on algorithms and large datasets. Machine learning allows systems to learn patterns from data instead of coding every rule manually. Deep learning uses multi-layer neural networks to learn complex patterns in images, language, speech, etc.</p>
    <p>Process: input data → algorithm/model → training → learned model → predictions/decisions. Models improve with more data.</p>

    <h2>AI in Everyday Life & Industries</h2>
    <ul class="bullet-points">
      <li>Virtual assistants, language translation apps, recommendation systems, search engines.</li>
      <li>Smart devices / IoT — home automation, personalization, predictive behavior.</li>
      <li>Education: adaptive learning, AI tutors, automated feedback.</li>
      <li>Healthcare: diagnostics, medical image analysis, predictive modeling.</li>
      <li>Business & Industry: data analysis, automated decision-making, logistics, marketing.</li>
      <li>Education: personalized content, AI tutors, accessible and efficient learning.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- TAB 7: STS Issues & Pros/Cons -->
  <div class="tab" id="tab7">
    <h2>C. STS Issues & Pros/Cons of AI</h2>

    <h3>1. Social Issues</h3>
    <ul class="bullet-points">
      <li><strong>Digital divide: </strong> Access to AI and digital technologies is uneven — people without devices, infrastructure, or digital literacy are at risk of being left behind. This deepens inequalities, because benefits of AI (information access, services, opportunities) may only reach privileged groups.</li>
      <li><strong>Job displacement: </strong>As AI automates tasks (especially routine/manual/repetitive), many traditional jobs may be eliminated. This can lead to unemployment, economic instability, and demand for new skill sets.</li>
      <li><strong>News/Misinformation: </strong>In the Information Age amplified by AI and social media, the ease of sharing information comes with risk — misinformation spreads fast, making it harder to discern truth.</li>
      <li><strong>Privacy risks: </strong> Many AI applications process large amounts of personal data (voice, location, behavior) — raising concerns about surveillance, data misuse, unauthorized profiling, and loss of privacy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Ethical Issues</h3>
    <ul class="bullet-points">
      <li><strong>Algorithmic bias: </strong> If training data reflects societal biases (e.g. race, gender, socioeconomic), AI systems can perpetuate or amplify unfairness — e.g. in hiring, lending, policing, services.</li>
      <li><strong>Deepfakes and misinformation: </strong> Advanced AI can create realistic fake images, video or audio (deepfakes), which can be misused for disinformation, identity fraud, manipulation, eroding trust in media. </li>
      <li><strong>Responsibility & accountability: </strong> With AI making or assisting decisions (hiring, medical diagnosis, sentencing, loan approval, etc.), it becomes critical to ask: Who is responsible when AI makes a wrong or harmful decision? Lack of transparency (“black box” systems) complicates accountability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Technical Issues</h3>
    <ul class="bullet-points">
      <li><strong>Cybersecurity threats: </strong> AI systems themselves can be vulnerable — data breaches, adversarial attacks (where tiny manipulations produce big errors), misuse of AI for malicious purposes (e.g. automated hacking, deepfake attacks).</li>
      <li><strong>Data storage and data governance: </strong> AI requires massive data storage; handling, storing, transferring, and protecting this data raises technical and governance challenges (scalability, privacy, compliance).</li>
      <li><strong>AI transparency / explainability: </strong> Many AI/ML models — especially deep learning models — are “black boxes”: it's difficult to explain how they arrive at a decision. This lack of interpretability is a serious technical challenge, especially in high-stakes domains (healthcare, justice, finance). </li>
    </ul>
